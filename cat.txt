The software provides an interface to an input file.

There will be a GUI that will accept an ASCII text file from the file system of the user. The GUI should display the number of sentences, words, newlines in the file. It should also display a histogram of all the words with the most and least occurring word (excluding common words, preposition, etc).

The GUI should also accept a second file containing some keywords. Display all the sentences in the first file which contains these keywords.

How to give input:

    Button1a: To explore the file system and choose a file.
    Button1b: To process the input file. Should also work in case the file is updated by the user.
    Button2a: To explore the file system and choose a second file containing the keywords.
    Button2b: Process both the files and display the output.
